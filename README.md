# Adblock Hosts

The action in this repro combines a list of ad-block lists which I normally use on AdGuard, Pi-Holes and Adaway.
With this I try to centralize the maintaining of my lists.

It will be updated everyday at 3 AM.

If you use the files, I'm not responsible for any issues which occur!

## Usage

The result of the daily combining can be found in two formats:

* [as adblock rules file](https://poeschl.github.io/adblock-hosts/adblock.txt) (recommended)
* [as hosts file](https://poeschl.github.io/adblock-hosts/hosts)
